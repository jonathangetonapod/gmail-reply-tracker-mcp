Client emails like mike.h@bookbiggerstages.org, jeff@sugarpixelspro.com, rich.c@tryflyingpoint.com were appearing as 'interested leads' in hidden gems results. ROOT CAUSE: Bison API returns 15 results per page (fixed), doesn't support per_page parameter. Initial pagination code used while loop with per_page=100, but API ignored it and always returned 15 results. Loop stopped after first page because it got 15 < 100 results. THE FIX: Explicit page fetching up to 10 pages (150 emails max). Stops early when empty page or < 15 results detected. PRODUCTION VALIDATION: Jeff Mikolai test shows page 1→15, page 2→15, page 3→15, page 4→5 emails. Total: 50 sender emails across 4 pages. IMPACT: Before: 15 sender emails → 35+ client emails appearing as leads ❌. After: 50 sender emails → All client emails properly filtered ✅.",

Example: Tracy Wallace (tracy@feast26.com) for Justin Ashcraft - marked interested but still showing as hidden gem. ROOT CAUSE: When you mark a thread as interested in Bison, the interested=true flag is often on the CLIENT'S reply to the lead, not the lead's incoming reply. Old logic only checked interested flag on incoming lead replies. Tracy's incoming reply had interested=false. Justin's outbound reply had interested=true but was filtered out as client reply. Result: Tracy's email never added to already_interested list. THE FIX: Also extract lead emails from client replies marked as interested. When interested=true on client reply (is_to_client=False), extract lead email from TO field and add to already_interested list. IMPACT: Before: Leads marked via client reply showing as hidden gems ❌. After: All marked leads properly excluded ✅.",

THE WORKAROUND: Switched from broken cursor-based pagination to timestamp-based advancement. Now uses last email's timestamp_email as next page's min_timestamp_created. Tracks email IDs (ue_id) to skip duplicates across pages. PRODUCTION VALIDATED: Penili Pulotu 60-day test fetched ALL 425 replies successfully (previous limit was 40 replies due to API bug).

ROOT CAUSE: Regex pattern ^\\s*stop\\s*!?\\s*$ used string anchors (^ and $), not line anchors. When reply had quoted text, $ didn't match because there was text after 'STOP!'. THE FIX: Added re.MULTILINE flag to regex search. Now ^ and $ match line boundaries. 'STOP!' on first line is correctly detected even with quoted text below. VALIDATION: Created test_stop_with_quote.py - all 4 test cases pass ✅. Both real-world cases now correctly categorized as COLD.",
